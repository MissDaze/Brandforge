  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: September 18, 2025</p>

  <h2>Subscription Refunds</h2>
  <p>BrandForge subscriptions are billed in advance and are non-refundable once activated. We encourage users to review tier details before subscribing.</p>

  <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
  <p>Refunds may be considered in cases of duplicate billing, technical failure, or unauthorized charges. To request a review, contact support@brandforge.ai within 7 days of the transaction.</p>

  <h2>Cancellation</h2>
  <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation prevents future billing but does not retroactively refund past charges.</p>

  <h2>Custom Branding Packages</h2>
  <p>Due to the personalized nature of branding packages, refunds are not available once generation begins. We aim to ensure satisfaction through clear onboarding and previews.</p>
